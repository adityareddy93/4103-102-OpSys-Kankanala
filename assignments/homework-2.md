##Multi-Tasking:
Multi-tasking more than one task are executed at the same time. In this technique the multiple tasks, also known as processes, share common
processing resources such as a CPU. In the case of a computer with single CPU, only one job can be processed at a time. Multitasking
solves the problem by scheduling and deciding which task should be the running task and when a waiting task should get turn.

##Multi-Programming:
Multi-programming is the technique of running several programs at a time using timesharing. It allows a computer to do several things at
the same time. Multiprogramming creates logical parallelism. The concept of multiprogramming is that the operating system keeps several
jobs in memory simultaneously.

##Multi-Processing:
Multi-processing refers to executing multiple processes (programs) at the same time. Multiprocessing operating systems enable several programs to run concurrently.

Multi-Threaded:
Multi-threading is an execution model that allows a single process to have multiple code segments run concurrently within the “context” of that process.
