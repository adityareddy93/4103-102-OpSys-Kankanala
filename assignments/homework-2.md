##Multi-Tasking:
                Multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming system that supports multiple programs to run concurrently. In
multitasking more than one task are executed at the same time. In this technique the multiple tasks, also known as processes, share common
processing resources such as a CPU. In the case of a computer with single CPU, only one job can be processed at a time. Multitasking
solves the problem by scheduling and deciding which task should be the running task and when a waiting task should get turn.
